Note: Intel is discontinuing ethernet blasters (no clear successor given). They are overpriced (~500 EUR) but useful. Maybe get one for your institute.

What can we merge? 

[See here](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/pull-requests/)

### Bitbucket issues ###

Have a look - the list is not getting shorter (yet?). Close things that are solved. Add issues if you discover them. Work to tackle them... Use CRITCAL for issues that are needed for the cosmic run.

# Cosmic run checklist #

### Before we go to PSI ###

* Can configure MuPix and MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI. *Ongoing, progress being made*
* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably *No more errors seen - is this gone?*
* Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI *Links ready, PLL firmware ready*
* Sorter works in HW with data generators and source (also for MuTrig) *Looks good for MuPix, stretch goal for MuTrig*
* We have a clear understanding how to handle 1.25 GBit link aligment, 8b/10b errors, resync etc. *Irrelevant if PLL is properly locked*
* We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend (i.e. not the switch and not the farm) *Set up in Mainz this week*
* We have a list of things to achieve with priorities

### Early stuff for PSI ###

* Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests
* Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
