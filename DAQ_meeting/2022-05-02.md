## Cosmic run at PSI

- [MK]
    - recabled and cabled optical cables to scifi
    - compiled telescope for trigger (added some regs to mon freq,
      not test on SWB, only on FEB)
    - when going dark do slow ramp (few ladders)
    - do tour before closing and check everything
- [MM]
    - check crate ctrl (some led's are on)
    - debug Nik's code (problem with long sleep working, but not without sleep),
      code get stuck when writing tdac, but works from nios
      (debug is in progress)
    - tdac works when doing slow, but not fast
- [SR]
    - fix online compilation and update midas -> all good now
    - rsync uses ssh (need ssh key), maybe use ftp? (discuss with Urs)
    - [NB] for now we use rsync (seems to work)

### Status and ongoing work

### TODO

* :white_check_mark:
  Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests
* :white_check_mark:
  Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* :white_check_mark:
  Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuPix from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.

* Can configure MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
  (in progress)
* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably (clock bug, anything else ?)
    - we should rework to use same reset sequence from test script in switch FE

* :white_check_mark:
  Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
  *Done by Nik, will need some testing*
  (see [Pixel LVDS Status](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/UI/Pixel%20LVDS%20UI.md)
  and [Data Flow Page](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/UI/Data%20Flow%20UI.md))

* Pixel sorter works in HW *To be tested*
* SciFi sorter works in HW *Stretch goal*
* We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend (i.e. not the switch and not the farm)
    - *Looked ok for first tests without much config or subdetectors.*
      *Keep eyes open when further developing this, should stay below 1s*
    - (farm_fe only worked on second run start - seem to not happen anymore)

* :white_check_mark:
  Make clear what needs to be run to initialize a clean system
  (ODB scripts, environment scripts, DAQ starting scripts)
  (see readme in online repo)

* Investigate rsysnc/lazy logger for data transfer to Merlin, (Urs)
    - should work in principle

* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up some FEBs
* :white_check_mark:
  Flash FEBs with subdet image and emergency image
* :white_check_mark:
  (done for one FEB, need to do for all of them)
  Test FEB boot, including emergency

* Maybe MIDAS UI for emergency boot?
* Very stretch goal: Parallel FEB flashing

* :white_check_mark:
  Test MIDAS interface to crate controllers
* :white_check_mark:
  Test MIDAS link monitoring
* :white_check_mark:
  Test MIDAS PLL monitoring
* :white_check_mark:
  Finish data flow monitoring, update SSCN bank spec, hook up SSCN and user page
* :white_check_mark:
  Test data flow monitoring
* :white_check_mark:
  Test data flow
* :white_check_mark:
  ODB and user interface for LVDS link masking
  (only for some chips, not for full matrix, but is enough for cosmic run)
* :white_check_mark:
  MuPix config with big DAQ system

* MuTrig config with big DAQ system (with midas)

* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up environment monitoring to DAQ
  (final test for liquid cooling and it is done)

* Hook up power control to DAQ
* Hook up helium system to DAQ
* Make sure history system works
* Define history plots, preferably in the respective FE code
  (see examples)
* Slowly get started on alarms (the clock box and temperatures therein could be a good starting point)
* Write manuals as you go along
* Be verbose on the elog
* MuPix masking from midas
    - (of individual pixel, sw is there but need to test)

* :white_check_mark:
  How to expose analyzer to outside word for people working remotely
    - there is custom page in onlineAna

## Rest of the world

### ZÃ¼rich ###

- [CMP] plan set up scifi daq in may/june, invites are sent around

### Geneva ###

### Heidelberg Pixels ###

- [LV]
    - impl custom page for inner tracker with QC tests
    - design of backplane is done, now checking mechanics

### Heidelberg telescope upgrade ###

- [Daniel]
    - board work with original pcie, no resource problems
    - ongoing work on ctrl sw and nios

### Heidelberg Tiles ###

### KIT ###

### MIDAS ###

- [SR]
    - basic possibility to get raw events in custom page in binary format
      (also possible to put events into analysis buffer,
      also possible to have different buffers)
    - what is the usage patterns?
        - [MK] idea is to use in event display (display last event)
        - [NB] filtering of events
          (where this bank is present or this subdet is live)
            - [SR] there are events ids (16 bit number to identify event)
              and trigger masks (16 bit mask about what is in event),
              mask is not used often but can be used for filtering
              (e.g. tell logger to put info in separate file
              for specific bits of mask)
            - [NB] use mask bits for cosmics, trigger, etc. (but not overuse)
        - [MK] write reconstructed event and then ask for this reco event from midas
        - [MK] grab some banks and make plot (e.g. IV curve)

## Pull requests

What can we merge? - Strategy decided, merges performed.

- we do merge of several branches, first online to dev and others,
  and then dev to online
- [NB] commit what we have on switch pc (sw and fw)
  and then merge to dev

## Bitbucket issues

Have a look - the list is not getting shorter (yet?).
Close things that are solved.
Add issues if you discover them.
Work to tackle them ...
Use CRITCAL for issues that are needed for the cosmic run.
