# Cosmic run checklist #

### Before we go to PSI ###

* Can configure MuPix and MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI. 
* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably 
* Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI 
* Sorter works in HW with data generators and source (also for MuTrig) 
* We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend (i.e. not the switch and not the farm) 


### Early stuff for PSI ###

* Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests :white_check_mark:
* Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack :white_check_mark:
* Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area :white_check_mark:
