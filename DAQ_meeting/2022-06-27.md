# DAQ meeting

Present: *...,etc.*

___
## Cosmic run at PSI

## fb/tl DAQ workshop in Mainz
* Datapath for Scifi and Tile defined. Example for Scifi:
![scifi_data_path.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/7zKBgbq/images/3583848254-scifi_data_path.png)

* Status Firmware Datapath:
MUX, Replacement for Sorter, Readout of Link Data Directly Done [mutrig_datapath_v2](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/branch/mutrig_datapath_v2)

* Record types: For Scifi and Tile the hit can be stored in 32bit after the sorter. Aim was to minimize the number of non timestamp bits in the sorter. Also the same datapath on the SWB as for the pixels can be used with 32bits. Only change for MuTrig is a second record type on the SWB.
* Sorter: [MuTrig Sorting](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/MuTrig%20sorting) was adopted with ideas from the Hackathon.
* Histograms: 

| Histograms         | Number of histograms | FPGA / PC | Status |
|--------------|-----------|------------|------|
| Hitmap (one bin per Channel) | Per ASIC | SWB analyzer        | Done |
| Distribution of fine counter      | 32 times per ASIC | SWB analyzer       | Done |

* Counters:

| Counter         | FPGA  | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Number of Frames Per ASIC | FEB        | Done |
| LVDS Errors Per ASIC | FEB       | Done |
| Number of Hits Per ASIC | FEB | Done |
| CRC Errors	Per ASIC | FEB | Done |
| Number of Hits Per Channel | FEB / SWB | Done on the FEB |
| Sync loss Per ASIC | FEB | Done |
| Sorter Counters | FEB | Done - same as Pixel |

* Status Bits on the FEB: PLL Lock, Link Lock, Sync per ASIC -> Done

* Discussion of Clustering on SWB for Scifi: 
MuTrig has logic for clustering of neighboring channels maybe this is already enough (needs to be simulated). In addition one can build a ribbon clustering pipline: "Offset RAM" per channel in time -> (Fine sort to less than 8ns) -> merge modules in time (should be possible by correctly connecting to the time merger) -> "Offset RAM" to align channels in space -> cluster. Which kind of additional clustering we need we should first simulate in software and than think about what gives us the best reduction. In general an overall reduction by a factor of 10 is needed (40Gbit/s to the Farm Input to SWB order of 100GBit/s)

* Configuration: Try to stay with the ODB (we dont have so much data - also MEG uses ODB configurations with 4000 values) and try to increase the performance of odb++ API to send ODB tree from the SWB to the Backend. At the moment it is one value per transaction. Different possibilities to increase the performance: store config already in a binary array, rewrite odb++ API for allowing to send the whole tree in one transaction (SR: Das odb++ API kann ich optimieren, die ODB selber aber nicht, die ist wie sie ist. Du kannst mal spasseshalber eine Struktur wir wir sie später haben werden (also >10000) in der ODB anlegen, und dann vom Subtree ein "save test.json" machen. Dann siehst Du wie man den Tree von A nach B bekommen wird. Wenn das 10 Sekunden dauert, haben wir verloren. ~I can optimize the API but not the ODB. We should try to configure a ODB like we would have it for the final detector and try with odbedit "save test.json" on the tree and transfer the tree from A to B. If this takes 10 sec we need to think again about another solution.) 
NOTE: Not only a MuTrig problem -> size of all the MuTrig config is on the same size of the MuPix chip config.

* Custom pages for monitoring & Control: We had a short presentation over the current pages we already have the Tile people will now first integrate all values into the ODB (T,V etc.) and than they will slowly start on building custom pages.

* Reset / Clock shifting for MuTrig: Bachelor Student from KIP will try to implement this shift entity to align different chips. Idea was to try the [altiobuf IP](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/jp/ja/programmable/support-resources/bulk-container/pdfs/literature/ug/ug-altiobuf.pdf)

* Analyzer: Short discussion on what is missing for MuTrig -> Do similar to pixel flow (data cleaner, clustering, mu3e root file)

* QC / Tuning: Sequencer Script for threshold tuning of different channels was implemented and test at PSI setup is planed for this week. Idea is to get the rate of each channel in firmware (block is implemented) and tune all channels to the lowest common threshold. Values are stored as for the pixel QC tests in the ODB.

* Demo: Mutrig + FEB simulation in questa: KB just showed us a few lines but the plan is to have at some point a demo on how to simulated the mutrig asic / datapath. MK has a setup for ghdl which uses ASIC data recorded from signal tab for the whole datapath.

* Structuring of subdetector software in switch_fe: We should the changes to the switch_fe and KB will slowly move things to the MuTrig class since at the moment some parts are in switch_fe and some are in the MuTrig class.

* PLL lock tests: We also played around with the MuTrig settings to find consistent settings for the PLL lock test. One "strange" thing we observed was that MuTrig2 does have a smaller range of stable settings. The baseline settings which where found for MuTrig1 did not work. To further analyze this issue we should repeat some DAC scans with the FEB setup and the evaluation setup. An example for MuTrig1 is shown here:

### Status and ongoing work

### TODO

* :white_check_mark:
  Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests
* :white_check_mark:
  Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* :white_check_mark:
  Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuPix from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
  (can manipulate config for each asic from UI,
  but no automated test yet)

* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably (clock bug, anything else ?)
    - we should rework to use same reset sequence from test script in switch FE

* :white_check_mark:
  Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
  *Done by Nik, will need some testing*

* :white_check_mark:
  MuPix masking from midas
    - (of individual pixel, sw is there but need to test)
    - work is in progress in mainz, can try soon

* :white_check_mark:
  How to expose analyzer to outside word for people working remotely
    - there is custom page in onlineAna

* Some not cleared buffers (from prev run) in the system (hardware and/or software)

* Write manuals as you go along
* Be verbose on the elog

* combined sorter for mutrig
