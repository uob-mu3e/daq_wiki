# DAQ meeting

Present: *...,etc.*

___
## Cosmic run at PSI

## fb/tl DAQ workshop in Mainz
* Datapath for Scifi and Tile defined. Example for Scifi:
![scifi_data_path.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/7zKBgbq/images/3583848254-scifi_data_path.png)

* Status Firmware Datapath:
MUX, Replacement for Sorter, Readout of Link Data Directly Done [mutrig_datapath_v2](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/branch/mutrig_datapath_v2)

* Record types: For Scifi and Tile the hit can be stored in 32bit after the sorter. Aim was to minimize the number of non timestamp bits in the sorter. Also the same datapath on the SWB as for the pixels can be used with 32bits. Only change for MuTrig is a second record type on the SWB.
* Sorter: [MuTrig Sorting](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/MuTrig%20sorting) was adopted with ideas from the Hackathon.
* Histograms: 

| Histograms         | Number of histograms | FPGA / PC | Status |
|--------------|-----------|------------|------|
| Hitmap (one bin per Channel) | Per ASIC | SWB analyzer        | Done |
| Distribution of fine counter      | 32 times per ASIC | SWB analyzer       | Done |

* Counters:

| Counter         | FPGA  | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Number of Frames Per ASIC | FEB        | Done |
| LVDS Errors Per ASIC | FEB       | Done |
| Number of Hits Per ASIC | FEB | Done |
| CRC Errors	Per ASIC | FEB | Done |
| Number of Hits Per Channel | FEB / SWB | Done on the FEB |
| Sync loss Per ASIC | FEB | Done |
| Sorter Counters | FEB | Done - same as Pixel |

* Status Bits on the FEB: PLL Lock, Link Lock, Sync per ASIC -> Done

* Discussion of Clustering on SWB for Scifi: 
MuTrig has logic for clustering of neighboring channels maybe this is already enough (needs to be simulated). In addition one can build a ribbon clustering pipline: "Offset RAM" per channel in time -> (Fine sort to less than 8ns) -> merge modules in time (should be possible by correctly connecting to the time merger) -> "Offset RAM" to align channels in space -> cluster. Which kind of additional clustering we need we should first simulate in software and than think about what gives us the best reduction. In general an overall reduction by a factor of 10 is needed (40Gbit/s to the Farm Input to SWB order of 100GBit/s)


### Status and ongoing work

### TODO

* :white_check_mark:
  Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests
* :white_check_mark:
  Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* :white_check_mark:
  Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuPix from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
  (can manipulate config for each asic from UI,
  but no automated test yet)

* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably (clock bug, anything else ?)
    - we should rework to use same reset sequence from test script in switch FE

* :white_check_mark:
  Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
  *Done by Nik, will need some testing*
  (see [Pixel LVDS Status](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/UI/Pixel%20LVDS%20UI.md)
  and [Data Flow Page](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/UI/Data%20Flow%20UI.md))

* Pixel sorter works in HW *To be tested*
    - still some missing sub-header, but can't reproduce in sim
    - need more examples of problems
* SciFi sorter works in HW *Stretch goal*

* :white_check_mark:
  We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend
  (i.e. not the switch and not the farm)
    - *Looked ok for first tests without much config or subdetectors.*
      *Keep eyes open when further developing this, should stay below 1s*
    - (farm_fe only worked on second run start - seem to not happen anymore)

* :white_check_mark:
  Make clear what needs to be run to initialize a clean system
  (ODB scripts, environment scripts, DAQ starting scripts)
  (see readme in online repo)

* Investigate rsysnc/lazy logger for data transfer to Merlin, (Urs)
    - should work in principle

* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up some FEBs
* :white_check_mark:
  Flash FEBs with subdet image and emergency image
* :white_check_mark:
  (done for one FEB, need to do for all of them)
  Test FEB boot, including emergency

* Maybe MIDAS UI for emergency boot?
* Very stretch goal: Parallel FEB flashing

* :white_check_mark:
  Test MIDAS interface to crate controllers
* :white_check_mark:
  Test MIDAS link monitoring
* :white_check_mark:
  Test MIDAS PLL monitoring
* :white_check_mark:
  Finish data flow monitoring, update SSCN bank spec, hook up SSCN and user page
* :white_check_mark:
  Test data flow monitoring
* :white_check_mark:
  Test data flow
* :white_check_mark:
  ODB and user interface for LVDS link masking
  (only for some chips, not for full matrix, but is enough for cosmic run)
* :white_check_mark:
  MuPix config with big DAQ system

* MuTrig config with big DAQ system (with midas)

* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up environment monitoring to DAQ
  (final test for liquid cooling and it is done)
* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up power control to DAQ
* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up helium system to DAQ

* Make sure history system works
* Define history plots, preferably in the respective FE code
  (see examples)
* Slowly get started on alarms (the clock box and temperatures therein could be a good starting point)
* :white_check_mark:
  MuPix masking from midas
    - (of individual pixel, sw is there but need to test)
    - work is in progress in mainz, can try soon

* :white_check_mark:
  How to expose analyzer to outside word for people working remotely
    - there is custom page in onlineAna

* Some not cleared buffers (from prev run) in the system (hardware and/or software)

* Write manuals as you go along
* Be verbose on the elog

* combined sorter for mutrig
