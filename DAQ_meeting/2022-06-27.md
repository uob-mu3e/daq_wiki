## Cosmic run at PSI

- [Ben]
    - optimizing (bank decoding)
      and analyzing (takes a lot of time, but getting better)
    - preparing pipeline for ana to process all the data
    - soon will have automatic system for all the cosmic data
- [MM]
    - zero suppression implemented for cosmic data
    - analyzed 5 min of data, seems to contain more physics that without zerosup
    - need to do more tests: sorter test (if sorter looses data)
    - see about few tens of MB/s
    - started to look into data files: see where we loose data
      (sometimes sorter produces nonsense, with zerosup there is new limit)
      (with current system we loose ~50% of data - somewhere in DMA?)
    - start to write sorter error counter
      (check protocol errors or missing headers)
    - on run start we get hits from prev run
      (smth is not cleared)
    - empty frames work ok in sorter
    - pixels have not much to optimize and they are ready for data
- [MK]
    - the data is not really zerosup, as you still write some headers
    - there is no back pressure from DMA
      (write to farm and grab data, if midas is too slow then
      we can loose data due to odb timeout)
    - can do bigger DMA buffer to get more data on switch
- [AK]
    - may be try 2 simulators to see if there are any not-trivial bugs

## fb/tl DAQ workshop in Mainz

* Datapath for Scifi and Tile defined.

  Example for Scifi:

  ![scifi_data_path.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/7zKBgbq/images/3583848254-scifi_data_path.png)

* Status Firmware Datapath:
    - MUX, Replacement for Sorter,
    - Readout of Link Data Directly Done
      [mutrig_datapath_v2](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/branch/mutrig_datapath_v2)

* Record types:
    - For Scifi and Tile the hit can be stored in 32bit after the sorter.
    - Aim was to minimize the number of non timestamp bits in the sorter.
    - Also the same datapath on the SWB as for the pixels can be used with 32bits.
    - Only change for MuTrig is a second record type on the SWB.

* Sorter:
    - [MuTrig Sorting](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/MuTrig%20sorting)
      was adopted with ideas from the Hackathon.

* Histograms: 

    | Histograms                   | Number of histograms | FPGA / PC    | Status |
    |------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------|
    | Hitmap (one bin per Channel) | Per ASIC             | SWB analyzer | Done   |
    | Distribution of fine counter | 32 times per ASIC    | SWB analyzer | Done   |

* Counters:

    | Counter                       | FPGA      | Status                |
    |-------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
    | Number of Frames Per ASIC     | FEB       | Done                  |
    | LVDS Errors Per ASIC          | FEB       | Done                  |
    | Number of Hits Per ASIC       | FEB       | Done                  |
    | CRC Errors	Per ASIC        | FEB       | Done                  |
    | Number of Hits Per Channel    | FEB / SWB | Done on the FEB       |
    | Sync loss Per ASIC            | FEB       | Done                  |
    | Sorter Counters               | FEB       | Done - same as Pixel  |

* Status Bits on the FEB:
    - PLL Lock, Link Lock, Sync per ASIC -> Done

* Discussion of Clustering on SWB for Scifi: 
    - MuTrig has logic for clustering of neighboring channels
        - maybe this is already enough (needs to be simulated)
    - In addition one can build a ribbon clustering pipline:
        - "Offset RAM" per channel in time -> (Fine sort to less than 8ns) ->
        - merge modules in time (should be possible by correctly connecting to the time merger) ->
        - "Offset RAM" to align channels in space -> cluster.
    - Which kind of additional clustering we need we should first simulate in software
      and than think about what gives us the best reduction.
    - In general an overall reduction by a factor of 10 is needed
      (40Gbit/s to the Farm Input to SWB order of 100GBit/s)

* Configuration:
    - Try to stay with the ODB
      (we dont have so much data - also MEG uses ODB configurations with 4000 values)
    - and try to increase the performance of odb++ API to send ODB tree from the SWB to the Backend.
    - At the moment it is one value per transaction.
    - Different possibilities to increase the performance:
        - store config already in a binary array,
        - rewrite odb++ API for allowing to send the whole tree in one transaction
```
  (SR: Das odb++ API kann ich optimieren, die ODB selber aber nicht, die ist wie sie ist.
  Du kannst mal spasseshalber eine Struktur wir wir sie spÃ¤ter haben werden (also >10000) in der ODB anlegen,
  und dann vom Subtree ein "save test.json" machen.
  Dann siehst Du wie man den Tree von A nach B bekommen wird.
  Wenn das 10 Sekunden dauert, haben wir verloren.
```
  ->
```
  I can optimize the API but not the ODB.
  We should try to configure a ODB like we would have it for the final detector
  and try with odbedit "save test.json" on the tree and transfer the tree from A to B.
  If this takes 10 sec we need to think again about another solution.) 
```

    - NOTE: Not only a MuTrig problem -> size of all the MuTrig config is on the same size of the MuPix chip config.

* Custom pages for monitoring & Control:
    - We had a short presentation over the current pages we already have
    - the Tile people will now first integrate all values into the ODB (T,V etc.)
    - and than they will slowly start on building custom pages.

* Reset / Clock shifting for MuTrig:
    - Bachelor Student from KIP will try to implement this shift entity
      to align different chips.
    - Idea was to try the [altiobuf IP](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/jp/ja/programmable/support-resources/bulk-container/pdfs/literature/ug/ug-altiobuf.pdf)

* Analyzer:
    - Short discussion on what is missing for MuTrig ->
    - Do similar to pixel flow (data cleaner, clustering, mu3e root file)

* QC / Tuning:
    - Sequencer Script for threshold tuning of different channels
      was implemented and test at PSI setup is planed for this week.
    - Idea is to get the rate of each channel in firmware (block is implemented)
      and tune all channels to the lowest common threshold.
    - Values are stored as for the pixel QC tests in the ODB.

* Demo:
    - Mutrig + FEB simulation in questa:
    - KB just showed us a few lines but the plan is to have at some point a demo
      on how to simulated the mutrig asic / datapath.
    - MK has a setup for ghdl which uses ASIC data recorded from signal tab for the whole datapath.

* Structuring of subdetector software in `switch_fe`:
    - We should the changes to the `switch_fe` and KB will slowly move things
      to the MuTrig class since at the moment some parts are in `switch_fe`
      and some are in the MuTrig class.

* PLL lock tests:
    - We also played around with the MuTrig settings to find consistent settings
      for the PLL lock test.
    - One "strange" thing we observed was that MuTrig2 does have a smaller range of stable settings.
    - The baseline settings which where found for MuTrig1 did not work.
    - To further analyze this issue we should repeat some DAC scans
      with the FEB setup and the evaluation setup.
    - An example for MuTrig1 is shown here:
      ![Image Pasted at 2022-6-15 14-11.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/7zKBgbq/images/399676339-Image%20Pasted%20at%202022-6-15%2014-11.png)

Discussion during DAQ meeting:

- [MK]
    - maybe use 2 scifi sorters
    - idea is to use 8 ns timestamps + 3 bits for remainder for finer time
    - and we keep depth of sorting same as for pixels
    - clustering can be done later on switch
- [NB]
    - looks possible
    - can trade between number of hits per timestamp and sorter depth
    - 8 ns can be beneficial for overlapping of rec frames
    - for now keep with 15 hits max per 8 ns per channel
- [NB]
    - we need conversion from/to midas/c-objects should be done
      in one place (to not duplicate same conversion in many places,
      this also is related to idmap) and we need it in some repo/code
- [MK]
    - some more test
        - sync mutrig with pixel in Mainz,
          used pin headers on fpga, send inj pulse to mutrig
          and see if two fpga's are in sync
        - see some correlation but problems due to reset not working
          (can't really do sync test -> need new working feb)

  Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuPix from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
* :white_check_mark:
  Can configure MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI.
  (can manipulate config for each asic from UI,
  but no automated test yet)

* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably (clock bug, anything else ?)
    - we should rework to use same reset sequence from test script in switch FE

* :white_check_mark:
  Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
  *Done by Nik, will need some testing*
  (see [Pixel LVDS Status](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/UI/Pixel%20LVDS%20UI.md)
  and [Data Flow Page](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/wiki/UI/Data%20Flow%20UI.md))

* Pixel sorter works in HW *To be tested*
    - still some missing sub-header, but can't reproduce in sim
    - need more examples of problems
* SciFi sorter works in HW *Stretch goal*

* :white_check_mark:
  We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend
  (i.e. not the switch and not the farm)
    - *Looked ok for first tests without much config or subdetectors.*
      *Keep eyes open when further developing this, should stay below 1s*
    - (farm_fe only worked on second run start - seem to not happen anymore)

* :white_check_mark:
  Make clear what needs to be run to initialize a clean system
  (ODB scripts, environment scripts, DAQ starting scripts)
  (see readme in online repo)

* Investigate rsysnc/lazy logger for data transfer to Merlin, (Urs)
    - should work in principle

* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up some FEBs
* :white_check_mark:
  Flash FEBs with subdet image and emergency image
* :white_check_mark:
  (done for one FEB, need to do for all of them)
  Test FEB boot, including emergency

* Maybe MIDAS UI for emergency boot?
* Very stretch goal: Parallel FEB flashing

  Hook up power control to DAQ
* :white_check_mark:
  Hook up helium system to DAQ

* Make sure history system works
    - some data missing in history?
      (when zoom in history, there seem to be missing data)
      need to be followed on

* Define history plots, preferably in the respective FE code
  (see examples)
* Slowly get started on alarms (the clock box and temperatures therein could be a good starting point)
* :white_check_mark:
  MuPix masking from midas
    - (of individual pixel, sw is there but need to test)
    - work is in progress in Mainz, can try soon

* :white_check_mark:
  How to expose analyzer to outside word for people working remotely
    - there is custom page in onlineAna
