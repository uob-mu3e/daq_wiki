# Firmware, Software and Setup Status and Activities #

### Mainz ###


### ZÃ¼rich ###

Significant progress made in SciFi DAQ hackathon: 

* Mutrig configuration via NIOS works fine

* PRBS data arrives to the switching board and the online analyzer

* Efforts to lock the PLL ongoing: injection with a 100 kHz pulse (in mutrig PLL config) shows a peak at the corresponding deltaT, but also presents a background of random data, probably coming from an empty FIFO in the FEB (under investigation, probably solved when updating firmware). The peak moves position when tuning the VNVCO parameter (as expected).

### Pull requests ###

What can we merge? 

[See here](https://bitbucket.org/mu3e/online/pull-requests/)

### Bitbucket issues ###

Have a look - the list is not getting shorter (yet?). Close things that are solved. Add issues if you discover them. Work to tackle them... Use CRITCAL for issues that are needed for the cosmic run.

# Cosmic run checklist #

### Before we go to PSI ###

* Can configure MuPix and MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI. 
* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably
* Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
* Sorter works in HW with data generators and source (also for MuTrig)
* We have a clear understanding how to handle 1.25 GBit link aligment, 8b/10b errors, resync etc.
* We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend (i.e. not the switch and not the farm)
* We have a list of things to achieve with priorities

### Early stuff for PSI ###

* Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests
* Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
