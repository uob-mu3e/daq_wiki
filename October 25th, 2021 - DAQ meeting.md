Present: *Sebastian, Martin, Cristina, Marius, Luigi, Frederik, Yannick, Nik*

# Setup status #
* Mainz lab back to lean table status, starting to set up.
* Luigi brought FEBs and an optical CC to HD, will ship to Mainz. Thomas will search for the ethernet CC. Crates are still attached to the frame, Mainz will start with the single crate here on site.
* Several PCs will need to be set up freshly. Some discussion on which Linux distribution to use. Go for OpenSuse Leap 15.3 for now. Instructions on how to set up a PC should go to a wiki page: [How to set up a DAQ PC](How to set up a DAQ PC). DAQ PCs should also have root and Geant4
* Yannick is getting started with the MuTRiG eval board in Geneva, will only return to full DAQ when this is running and understood. Konrad is supporting from HD.
* 2 Telescope DABs are being equipped this week, tests will follow ASAP. Ideally there will be four cards in December.
