# Status of set-ups #

* Mainz: 
* Heidelberg Pixel:
* Heidelberg Tiles:
* Geneva: (after one week of "not much going on" for this side): 
1. clock evaluation board have been programmed, should be fine to give the 2 clocks needed. One to the A10 and the other to the FEB.
2. Realised that I need a female/male extension MTP cable, I have a male/male ...(Need to make sure it's the good orientation I think ?(line 1-12))
3. Waiting for the backplane to complete the chain (connecting the DAB and our SMB to it).

Next step is to see main menu of nios terminal, when the A10 is connected.
