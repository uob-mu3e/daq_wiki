Needed: Custom pages for link and PLL monitoring

## FEBs ##

What registers do I need to read to get the LVDS link status? Where can we create single, sticky status bits with either reset on read or reset on setting some register?

How about PLLs?

## SW and Farm boards ##

Registers for link monitoring? PLL monitoring? Sticky mechanism?

## Merging data flow ##

I guess this is the SSCN bank for the switching board. Needs another name for the farm. What needs to be shwon? Update?
