# Goals for 2022 #

## Spring Cosmic Run ##

### Goals (Proposal) ###

* Stable data taking using full chain (FEB, SW, Farm) and with MuPix and MuTrig

### Before we go to PSI ###

* Can configure MuPix and MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI
* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably
* Have diagnostics for all links and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
* Sorter works in HW with data generators and source (also for MuTrig)
* We have a clear understanding how to handle 1.25 GBit link aligment, 8b/10b errors, resync etc.
* We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend (i.e. not the switch and not the farm)
* We have a list of things to achieve with priorities
* We have committments from the participating groups towards these things

### Early suff for PSI ###

* Set-up network including dedicated gateway
* Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area

## Autumn Integration Run ##

* Stable data taking using full chain (FEB, SW, Farm) and with MuPix and MuTrig (all three systems) and beam
* Slow control fully interated
* Database fully integrated
* Lots of online monitoring
