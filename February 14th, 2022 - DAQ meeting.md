# Cosmic run checklist #

* Many points being worked at

### Before we go to PSI ###

* Can configure MuPix and MuTrig from MIDAS via FEB reliably and with a MIDAS UI. 
* FEB SlowControl interface works reliably
* Have diagnostics for all links, PLLs and clocks in place, including MIDAS UI
* Sorter works in HW with data generators and source (also for MuTrig)
* We have a clear understanding how to handle 1.25 GBit link aligment, 8b/10b errors, resync etc.
* We can do run starts and configs with the ODB on the backend (i.e. not the switch and not the farm)
* We have a list of things to achieve with priorities

### Early stuff for PSI ###

* Set-up network including dedicated gateway, do performance tests
* Clear and re-cable the fibre fanout rack
* Recuperate the 2-3 fibres from the area
